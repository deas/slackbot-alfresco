slackbot-alfresco
====================

Slack is awesome, Alfresco is awesome, and the combination of the two is extremely awesome.
This project implements a simple chatbot for Slack that connects to your Alfresco instance and provides some
handy functionality:

* Automatically copy files uploaded into a Slack chat to an Alfresco site.
* Archives parts of Slack chats to an Alfresco site.
* Allows simple searching of Alfresco from within Slack, with links directly to results.
